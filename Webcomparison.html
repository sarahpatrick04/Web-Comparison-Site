	<h5>
	Lets Go Rally, is a small business which offers creative direction and help with branding and as they say digital things. 
	<br>
	I felt that this website immediately caught my attention by its interesting graphics and interactive way of 
	<br>seeing each different project thats displayed on their main portfolio website. 
	<p>
	I felt the strengths for this site was its simplified graphics, muted colors, and the interactive display of votes for each of their projects. 
	<br>A weakness would be that when I first loaded the site it took until the fifth time reloading for there graphics to actually work. 
	<br>Without them, there were no way to click on a project or see a glimpse or shot of what the project might even look like.</h5>

	<h5>This particular website was my most favorite in there choice of color and simplified icons and 2d illustrations.
	<br>I felt its strengths were in the use of magnifying over the main illustration on the main page, where it showed the colorful and friendly illustrations. I felt this 
	<br>showed there dedication and good work ethic with these very detailed characters and story. I also liked the vertical scrolling as well as the simple menu icons 
	<br>which when you hovered over would show a description. I felt it was very useful in putting all the content on the main page without having to direct you to too many different
	<br>parts of the site. The only weakness I felt about this website was that the headlines in the illustration looked faded and hard to read, and just by my first reaction when
	<br>seeing the website I would have thought those were links until noticing the very small menu that scrolled with the page in the top heading of the site.</h5></p>

	<h1>The Awful</h1>
	<p>
	<p>
	<h2>Cyclelux</h2>
	<h3><i>A Online Shop for Bike Enthusiasts</i></h3>
	<p>	
	<p><a href="http://cyclelux.cc">Cyclelux.cc</a></p>
	<p>
	<img src="/Users/Sarah-Patrick/Documents/Interactive Publishing I/Web Comparison Site/Images/Cyclelux_Web.png" title="Image Source|Cyclelux"></img>
	<p>
	<h5>
	This website Cyclelux, is a digital online shop. I found this to be a unsuccessful interactive site because although they have interactive
	<br>hover over links where it displays the price of each product, the graphics are too simplified and it looks like it took two minutes to do
	<br>and also the pricing tags are displayed on top of some images and some are displayed right next to each product.
	<br>In addition, I was disappointed to see that  a website with so much vertical information and products would not add any interactive scrolling or
	<br>menu to display each image. The site also does not have any hovering links and is just a normal link that directs you to different parts of the website.</h5>

	</p>
	<h5>This website was one of the most worst designed websites I had ever seen.
	<br>It also gave me the feeling of having a seizure from all the
	<br>flashing images and bright text all over the page. It was also very outdated and had horrible quality images. The website really spoke
	<br>for itself in the quality of an interactive website, and I also felt like the image explains this completely.
	<p>
	Some of the weaknesses I noticed was obviously the annoying colored text, body copy and some guys random profile which he
	<br>states its a questionare. This websites seemed like a waste of internet space.
